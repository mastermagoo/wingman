# Meta-Worker 1: Write Instructions for 10 Workers

**Date:** 2025-11-28  
**Status:** PENDING EXECUTION  
**Focus:** Phase 1 - Environment validation and SAP namespace setup

---

## YOUR TASK

You are Meta-Worker 1. Your job is to write complete 10-point work instructions for the following workers:

**Assigned Workers:** Worker 1, Worker 2, Worker 3, Worker 4, Worker 5, Worker 6, Worker 7, Worker 8, Worker 9, Worker 10  
**Total Workers:** 10  
**Focus Area:** Phase 1 - Environment validation and SAP namespace setup

---

## INSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS

For EACH of your assigned workers, you MUST create a complete instruction file following the 10-Point Framework:

### Required Sections (ALL 10 POINTS):

1. **DELIVERABLES** - Specific files, schemas, configurations to create
2. **SUCCESS_CRITERIA** - Measurable criteria for completion
3. **BOUNDARIES** - What can/cannot be modified
4. **DEPENDENCIES** - Prerequisites and worker dependencies
5. **MITIGATION** - Rollback, escalation, failure handling
6. **TEST_PROCESS** - Exact commands to validate
7. **TEST_RESULTS_FORMAT** - JSON structure for results
8. **TASK_CLASSIFICATION** - MECHANICAL/CREATIVE/HYBRID with tool selection
9. **RETROSPECTIVE** - Time tracking, lessons learned
10. **PERFORMANCE_REQUIREMENTS** - Baseline, targets, monitoring

---

## SOURCE MATERIALS

1. **Original Plan:** `/Volumes/Data/ai_projects/intel-system/docs/00-strategic/Environment Strategy/MEGA_DELEGATION_200_WORKERS_PLAN.md`
   - Contains detailed worker definitions with deliverables, success criteria, boundaries, dependencies, test processes

2. **Advanced Plan:** `/Volumes/Data/ai_projects/intel-system/docs/00-strategic/Environment Strategy/MEGA_DELEGATION_200_WORKERS_PLAN_ADVANCED.md`
   - Contains compressed 2-day schedule, batch assignments, LLM provider assignments

3. **Template:** `/Volumes/Data/ai_projects/intel-system/ai-workers/workers/WORKER_INSTRUCTION_TEMPLATE.md`
   - Use as structure reference (but extract real details from plans)

---

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

For each worker, create a file:
- **Location:** `ai-workers/workers/WORKER_[ID]_[TITLE].md`
- **Format:** Complete 10-point instruction following template
- **Quality:** Must be detailed enough for autonomous execution
- **Validation:** Will be validated by Wingman (must score ≥80%)

---

## WORKER DETAILS TO EXTRACT

For each assigned worker, extract from the original plan:
- Worker ID and title
- Deliverable (specific files/schemas/configs)
- Success criteria (measurable)
- Boundaries (TEST only, what can/cannot modify)
- Dependencies (services, previous workers)
- Test process (exact commands)
- Test results format
- Risk assessment
- Quality metrics

Then expand with:
- **MITIGATION** (Point 5): Rollback procedures, escalation triggers
- **TASK_CLASSIFICATION** (Point 8): Determine MECHANICAL/CREATIVE/HYBRID, select tools
- **RETROSPECTIVE** (Point 9): Time estimates, what to track
- **PERFORMANCE_REQUIREMENTS** (Point 10): Baseline manual time, automation targets

---

## EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Read the original plan file to understand each worker's requirements
2. For each assigned worker:
   - Extract all available details from original plan
   - Fill in missing 10-point framework sections
   - Create complete instruction file
3. Save each instruction file to: `ai-workers/workers/WORKER_[ID]_[TITLE].md`
4. Create summary file: `ai-workers/workers/META_WORKER_1_SUMMARY.md`

---

## QUALITY STANDARDS

Each instruction must:
- ✅ Have all 10 points complete
- ✅ Be specific enough for autonomous execution
- ✅ Include exact commands for testing
- ✅ Define clear success criteria
- ✅ Specify rollback procedures
- ✅ Include performance targets

---

**Meta-Worker 1 Assignment Complete When:**
- All 10 worker instruction files created
- Summary file created
- Ready for Wingman validation
